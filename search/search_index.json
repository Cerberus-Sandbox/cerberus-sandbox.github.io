The following procedure explains how to build this documentation on your own system, and how to upgrade the live one. Local Setup In order to build the local version of this documentation, the mkdocs package is required: $ pip install mkdocs $ mkdocs -V mkdocs, version 1.1.2 from /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mkdocs (Python 3.8) To get the last version of the documentation's file, clone the Cerberus Sandbox public GitHub repository in one of your local folder: $ git clone https://github.com/Cerberus-Sandbox/cerberus-sandbox.github.io The GitHub repository is composed of two branches: main and master . The first one holds the raw mkdocs files, and the second one is the compiled version of the website used by GitHub to host the live instance. You should never edit the master branch by hand. Even in a local setup. Now that you hold a local copy of the documentation website, simply run mkdocs build to generate the compiled HTML pages. The entrypoint of the local setup is located in site/index.html . If you want to edit the live content, or if you need to add a new page, everything will be done in the docs/ folder. A typical architecture can be resumed by the follwoing: docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 I. Subsection n\u00b01 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 1. Doc 1.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2. Doc 2.md \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 3. Doc 3.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 II. Subsection n\u00b02 Each folder holds a subsection of the documentation, and each markedown file stores the actual content of the page. You can refer to the following cheatsheet to edit your markedown file: www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ Upgrading the live version Whenever the local content is ready to go, you can use the automatic script ship-to-prod.sh to push the new content on GitHub and rebuild the mkdocs instance, or choose to do it by hands. The sript is located at the root folder of the cerberus-sandbox repository. First, the mkdocs sources need to be saved in the main branch: $ git pull $ git checkout main $ git add docs/* $ git add mkdocs.yml $ git commit -m \"your commit message\" $ git push If you don't push to the main branch, the next modifications will erase yours, and nobody will be able to track and download your modifications. Then, the mkdocs sources can be compiled and shiped to the github master branch: $ mkdocs gh-deploy --force --remote-branch master And that's it.

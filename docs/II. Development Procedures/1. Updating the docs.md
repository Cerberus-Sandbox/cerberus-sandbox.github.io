## Updating the docs

This online documentation is generated using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and is hosted on a [Github Pages](https://github.com/Cerberus-Sandbox/cerberus-sandbox.github.io).

The following procedure explains how to build this documentation on your own system, and how to upgrade the live one.

### Local Setup
In order to build the local version of this documentation, the `mkdocs` package is required:
```bash
$ pip install mkdocs
$ mkdocs -V
  mkdocs, version 1.1.2 from /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mkdocs (Python 3.8)
```

To get the last version of the documentation's file, clone the Cerberus Sandbox public GitHub repository in one of your local folder:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Cerberus-Sandbox/cerberus-sandbox.github.io
```

The GitHub repository is composed of two branches: `main` and `master`.
The first one holds the raw mkdocs files, and the second one is the compiled version of the website used by GitHub to host the live instance.

You should **never** edit the `master` branch by hand. Even in a local setup.

Now that you hold a local copy of the documentation website, simply run `mkdocs build` to generate the compiled HTML pages.

The entrypoint of the local setup is located in `site/index.html`.

If you want to edit the live content, or if you need to add a new page, everything will be done in the `docs/` folder.

A typical architecture can be resumed by the following:
```bash
 docs/
 ├── I. Subsection n°1
 │   ├── 1. Doc 1.md
 │   ├── 2. Doc 2.md
 │   └── 3. Doc 3.md
 └── II. Subsection n°2
```

Each folder holds a subsection of the documentation, and each markedown file stores the actual content of the page.

You can refer to the following cheatsheet to edit your markedown file: [www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Upgrading the live version

Whenever the local content is ready to go, you can use the automatic script `ship-to-prod.sh` to push the new content on GitHub and rebuild the mkdocs instance, or choose to do it by hands.

The script is located at the root folder of the _cerberus-sandbox_ repository.

You can choose to pass a short description of your modification to the script, as a string value, for a better understanding of each commit.

```bash
$ ./ship-to-prod.sh "index update + typo"
```

First, the mkdocs sources need to be saved in the `main` branch:
```bash
$ git pull
$ git checkout main
$ git add docs/*
$ git add mkdocs.yml
$ git commit -m "your commit message"
$ git push
```

If you don't push to the `main` branch, the next modifications will erase yours, and nobody will be able to track and download your modifications.

Then, the mkdocs sources can be compiled and shiped to the github `master` branch:
```bash
$ mkdocs gh-deploy --force --remote-branch master
```

And that's it. Remember that you'll have to wait several minutes to see your updates on the live page !
